# Work Log - Pantheon Media Project

## Date: March 15, 2025

### Project Overview
Working on connecting the movie information buttons and video player functionality in the Pantheon Media streaming platform, and fixing critical issues with video preview playback.

### Current Branch
`feature/connect-movie-info-buttons` â†’ Merged to `main`

### Current State Assessment

1. **Hover Preview Module**:
   - The small preview that appears when hovering over a movie card
   - Contains a play button and an "arrow down" button (ChevronDown)
   - Connected the arrow down button to open the MovieInfoModal
   - Connected the play button to the PlayerContext

2. **Large Information Modal**:
   - Summoned when clicking the "i More info" button in the hero section or the arrow down button in hover previews
   - Displays comprehensive information about the selected movie
   - Fixed critical issue with video previews not working after first use

3. **Video Player**:
   - "Watch Our Work" button launches the player
   - Fixed black screen issue by ensuring proper HLS initialization
   - Improved video loading and playback reliability

### Technical Details

1. **Video Loading Process**:
   - Videos are fetched using the `getPreviewVideo` function in `bunny-stream.ts`
   - Added `forceRefresh` option to bypass cache when needed
   - Improved cache handling logic to be more reliable

2. **Player Context**:
   - The `PlayerContext` manages video playback state
   - The `playMovie` function takes video URL, poster URL, and title
   - It stores this data in sessionStorage and navigates to the player page

3. **Movie Player**:
   - Enhanced HLS initialization with better error recovery settings
   - Added debug mode to HLS for better troubleshooting
   - Implemented proper cleanup when components unmount

### Today's Completed Tasks

#### 1. Connected the Arrow Down Button in Hover Preview
- [x] Added an `onMoreInfo` callback prop to the PantheonPreview component
- [x] Connected the arrow down button click to call this callback
- [x] Updated the PantheonMediaContainer to handle this callback and open the MovieInfoModal
- [x] Passed the movie data to the MovieInfoModal

#### 2. Fixed Video Player Loading
- [x] Debugged and fixed the black screen issue
- [x] Ensured the correct video URL format is being passed (HLS m3u8)
- [x] Verified the Bunny.net integration is working correctly
- [x] Added proper HLS initialization in the MoviePlayer component
- [x] Connected all play buttons to use the same reliable method for launching videos

#### 3. Fixed Video Preview Caching Issue
- [x] Added `forceRefresh` option to bypass cache when needed
- [x] Implemented complete state reset when modal opens
- [x] Added proper cleanup when modal/preview closes
- [x] Enhanced HLS initialization with better error recovery settings
- [x] Added `removeAttribute('src')` and `load()` calls to fully reset video elements
- [x] Forced fresh data retrieval on each modal open

### Technical Implementation Details

#### 1. Enhanced HLS Configuration
```typescript
const hls = new Hls({
  enableWorker: true,
  lowLatencyMode: true,
  debug: true,
  fragLoadingMaxRetry: 5,
  manifestLoadingMaxRetry: 5,
  levelLoadingMaxRetry: 5
});
```

#### 2. Complete Cleanup Process
```typescript
// When modal closes
if (videoRef.current) {
  videoRef.current.pause();
  videoRef.current.removeAttribute('src');
  videoRef.current.load();
}

if (hlsRef.current) {
  hlsRef.current.stopLoad();
  hlsRef.current.destroy();
  hlsRef.current = null;
}
```

#### 3. Cache Bypass Mechanism
```typescript
// In bunny-stream.ts
interface GetPreviewVideoOptions {
  // ...existing options
  forceRefresh?: boolean;
}

// Check cache only if forceRefresh is false
if (!options.forceRefresh && cached && Date.now() - cached.timestamp < CACHE_DURATION) {
  // Use cached data
}
```

### Files Modified
1. `src/components/media/PantheonPreview.tsx`
2. `src/components/media/PantheonMediaContainer.tsx`
3. `src/components/player/MoviePlayer.tsx`
4. `src/components/ui/movie-info-modal.tsx`
5. `src/services/bunny-stream.ts`
6. `src/components/hero.tsx`

### Testing
- [x] Verified that all connections work as expected
- [x] Confirmed that the correct video is loaded in the player
- [x] Verified that video previews work consistently on repeated modal openings
- [x] Confirmed that the modal can be opened and closed multiple times without issues
- [x] Tested that video playback starts correctly each time
- [x] Checked that there are no memory leaks or resource buildup

### Lessons Learned
1. HLS instances need to be properly destroyed and recreated between video initializations
2. Video elements need complete cleanup including removing the source attribute
3. Forcing fresh data retrieval can be more reliable than relying on cached data for media elements
4. Adding debug mode to HLS is valuable for troubleshooting playback issues

### Next Steps
- Monitor for any remaining issues with video playback
- Consider implementing similar fixes in other components that use HLS
- Add more comprehensive error recovery for network issues
