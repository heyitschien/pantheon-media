# Work Log - Pantheon Media Project

## Date: March 15, 2024

### Project Overview
Working on connecting the movie information buttons and video player functionality in the Pantheon Media streaming platform to ensure a seamless user experience.

### Current Branch
`feature/connect-movie-info-buttons`

### Current State Assessment

1. **Hover Preview Module**:
   - The small preview that appears when hovering over a movie card
   - Contains a play button and an "arrow down" button (ChevronDown)
   - Currently, the arrow down button doesn't have functionality connected
   - The play button in this module is not connected to the PlayerContext

2. **Large Information Modal**:
   - Currently summoned when clicking the "i More info" button in the hero section
   - Displays comprehensive information about the selected movie
   - Not connected to the hover preview module's arrow down button

3. **Video Player**:
   - "Watch Our Work" button launches the player
   - Player currently shows a black screen instead of loading the feature video
   - The issue may be related to how the video URL is passed to the player
   - The MoviePlayer component expects an HLS stream URL (m3u8)
   - Bunny.net integration is set up with fallback mechanisms

### Technical Details

1. **Video Loading Process**:
   - Videos are fetched using the `getPreviewVideo` function in `bunny-stream.ts`
   - The function attempts to fetch from Bunny.net API first
   - Falls back to static assets if API fails
   - The main video asset ID is `13904fa8-dda5-4e9e-88c4-0d57fa9af6c4`

2. **Player Context**:
   - The `PlayerContext` manages video playback state
   - The `playMovie` function takes video URL, poster URL, and title
   - It stores this data in sessionStorage and navigates to the player page

3. **Movie Player**:
   - The `MoviePlayer` component directly uses the `src` prop for the video element
   - It logs errors when video loading fails
   - The player may not be properly handling HLS streams

### Today's Tasks

1. **Connect the Arrow Down Button in Hover Preview**:
   - Add an `onMoreInfo` callback prop to the PantheonPreview component
   - Connect the arrow down button click to call this callback
   - Update the PantheonMediaContainer to handle this callback and open the MovieInfoModal
   - Pass the movie data to the MovieInfoModal

2. **Fix Video Player Loading**:
   - Debug why the player shows a black screen
   - Check if the correct video URL format is being passed (HLS m3u8)
   - Ensure the Bunny.net integration is working correctly
   - Add proper HLS initialization in the MoviePlayer component if needed
   - Connect all play buttons to use the same reliable method for launching videos

3. **Testing**:
   - Test all connections to ensure they work as expected
   - Verify that the correct video is loaded in the player
   - Check browser console for any errors related to video loading

### Files to Modify

1. `src/components/media/PantheonPreview.tsx` - Add functionality to the arrow down button
2. `src/components/media/PantheonMediaContainer.tsx` - Handle the more info callback
3. `src/components/player/MoviePlayer.tsx` - Add proper HLS initialization if needed
4. `src/contexts/PlayerContext.tsx` - Ensure correct video data is passed

### Implementation Strategy

1. **For the Arrow Down Button**:
   - Modify the PantheonPreview component to handle clicks on the arrow down button
   - Create a connection between the hover preview and the information modal
   - Ensure the modal receives the correct movie data

2. **For the Video Player**:
   - Check if the MoviePlayer component is properly initializing HLS for m3u8 streams
   - Add HLS initialization similar to what's in the PantheonPreview component
   - Ensure all play buttons pass the correct video URL format
   - Add better error handling and logging

### Expected Outcome
By the end of today, users should be able to:
1. Click the arrow down button on the hover preview to see the detailed information modal
2. Click any play button to launch the video player with the correct video playing (not a black screen)
3. Have a seamless experience navigating between these components

This implementation will complete the core user journey for video discovery and playback in the Pantheon Media platform.

### Notes
- The hero section's "i More info" button already works correctly - use this as a reference
- The video player infrastructure is in place but needs debugging to ensure proper content loading
- Focus on creating a consistent experience across all entry points to the video player
- The main issue with the black screen is likely related to HLS initialization in the MoviePlayer component
