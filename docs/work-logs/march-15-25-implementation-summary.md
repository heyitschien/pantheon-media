# Implementation Summary - March 15, 2024

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to fix the video player and connect the movie information buttons in the Pantheon Media streaming platform.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Video Player Black Screen**
   - The MoviePlayer component wasn't properly handling HLS streams
   - Console showed "DEMUXER_ERROR_DETECTED_HLS" errors
   - The video element needed HLS.js initialization for m3u8 streams

2. **Arrow Down Button in Hover Preview**
   - The ChevronDown button in PantheonPreview wasn't connected to any functionality
   - Needed to open the MovieInfoModal when clicked

3. **Play Button in Hover Preview**
   - The play button in PantheonPreview wasn't connected to the PlayerContext
   - Needed to launch the video player with the correct video

## Changes Made

### 1. MoviePlayer Component
- Added HLS.js initialization to properly handle m3u8 streams
- Added better error handling and logging for video playback issues
- Implemented proper cleanup of HLS instances
- Added support for different browser capabilities (Safari native HLS)

### 2. PantheonPreview Component
- Added `onMoreInfo` callback prop
- Connected the ChevronDown button to call this callback
- Added `handlePlay` function to use the PlayerContext
- Ensured proper video URL and poster URL are passed to the player

### 3. PantheonMediaContainer Component
- Added state for modal visibility
- Added `handleMoreInfo` function to open the MovieInfoModal
- Connected the PantheonPreview's `onMoreInfo` callback to this function
- Added MovieInfoModal component with the correct movie data

### 4. Hero Component
- Enhanced the `handlePlayClick` function with better logging
- Added validation to ensure the video URL is an HLS stream

## Technical Details

### HLS.js Integration
The key to fixing the video player was properly initializing HLS.js for m3u8 streams:

```javascript
// Check if the source is an HLS stream (m3u8)
if (src.includes('.m3u8')) {
  console.log('Detected HLS stream, initializing HLS.js');
  initHls(videoRef.current, src);
} else {
  console.log('Not an HLS stream, using standard video element');
  videoRef.current.src = src;
}
```

The `initHls` function handles:
- Creating an HLS.js instance
- Attaching it to the video element
- Loading the source
- Setting up error handling
- Handling browser compatibility

### Component Communication
For the arrow down button functionality, we implemented a callback pattern:

1. PantheonMediaContainer defines `handleMoreInfo` function
2. This function is passed to PantheonPreview as `onMoreInfo` prop
3. PantheonPreview calls this function when the arrow down button is clicked
4. The function opens the MovieInfoModal with the correct movie data

## Testing
The changes were tested to ensure:
- The video player correctly loads and plays HLS streams
- The arrow down button in the hover preview opens the movie info modal
- The play button in the hover preview launches the video player
- All components properly clean up resources when unmounted

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring for any video playback issues
- Consider adding quality selection for video playback
- Implement analytics for video engagement
- Add more comprehensive error recovery mechanisms
