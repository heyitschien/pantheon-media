# CI/CD Pipeline Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) strategy for the Modern Streaming Hub project. The pipeline is designed to ensure code quality, maintain testing standards, and automate deployment processes.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Continuous Integration (CI)

#### Stage 1: Basic Quality Checks
- **Trigger**: On every push and pull request
- **Steps**:
  1. Code checkout
  2. Environment setup
  3. Dependencies installation
  4. TypeScript type checking
  5. ESLint code linting
  6. Unit tests execution
  7. Build verification

#### Stage 2: Advanced Quality Checks
- **Trigger**: After Stage 1 success
- **Steps**:
  1. Integration tests
  2. Code coverage reporting
  3. Bundle size analysis
  4. Accessibility checks

### 2. Continuous Deployment (CD)

#### Development Deployments
- **Trigger**: Pull request creation/update
- **Environment**: Preview
- **Purpose**: Feature testing and review
- **Process**:
  1. Generate unique preview URL
  2. Deploy to Vercel preview environment
  3. Post preview URL to PR

#### Staging Deployments
- **Trigger**: Push to main branch
- **Environment**: Staging
- **Purpose**: Integration testing
- **Process**:
  1. Deploy to staging environment
  2. Run smoke tests
  3. Monitor for any issues

#### Production Deployments
- **Trigger**: Release tag creation
- **Environment**: Production
- **Process**:
  1. Deploy to production environment
  2. Run health checks
  3. Monitor metrics

## Quality Gates

### Code Quality
- TypeScript errors: 0
- ESLint errors: 0
- Test coverage thresholds:
  - Lines: ≥90%
  - Functions: ≥90%
  - Branches: ≥80%

### Performance Metrics
- Lighthouse scores:
  - Performance: ≥90
  - Accessibility: ≥90
  - Best Practices: ≥90
  - SEO: ≥90
- Bundle size limits:
  - Main bundle: ≤250KB
  - Chunk size: ≤100KB

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Pipeline Setup
1. Configure GitHub Actions workflow
2. Implement basic CI checks
3. Set up Vercel deployment integration
4. Configure branch protection rules

### Phase 2: Enhanced Quality Checks
1. Add code coverage reporting
2. Implement bundle size monitoring
3. Add accessibility checks
4. Configure advanced test runners

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Implement performance monitoring
2. Add security scanning
3. Configure automated dependency updates
4. Set up monitoring and alerts

## GitHub Actions Configuration

### Main Workflow Structure
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
      - name: Setup Node.js
      - name: Install dependencies
      - name: Type check
      - name: Lint
      - name: Test
      - name: Build

  deploy:
    needs: quality
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Vercel
```

## Branch Protection Rules

### Main Branch
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Include administrators

### Feature Branches
- Enforce naming convention
- Require CI checks to pass
- Allow force pushing

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Metrics
- Build success rate
- Test coverage trends
- Deployment frequency
- Mean time to recovery
- Change failure rate

### Alerts
- Build failures
- Test failures
- Coverage drops
- Performance degradation
- Security vulnerabilities

## Security Considerations

### Secrets Management
- Store sensitive data in GitHub Secrets
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use environment-specific secrets

### Access Control
- Limit deployment permissions
- Audit access regularly
- Implement role-based access

## Best Practices

### Commits and PRs
- Use conventional commit messages
- Keep PRs focused and small
- Include tests with changes
- Update documentation

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests before code (TDD)
- Maintain test independence
- Mock external dependencies
- Use realistic test data

### Deployment Strategy
- Use feature flags
- Implement gradual rollouts
- Maintain rollback capability
- Monitor post-deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. Failed builds
2. Test flakiness
3. Deployment failures
4. Performance regressions

### Resolution Steps
1. Check logs
2. Review recent changes
3. Verify environment
4. Test locally
5. Rollback if necessary

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. Automated visual regression testing
2. E2E test automation
3. Advanced performance monitoring
4. AI-powered code review

### Long-term Goals
1. Zero-downtime deployments
2. Automated security patching
3. Advanced monitoring dashboards
4. Self-healing capabilities

## Resources

### Documentation
- [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
- [Vercel Documentation](https://vercel.com/docs)
- [Jest Documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)

### Tools
- GitHub Actions
- Vercel
# Start of Selection
- Vite Test (currently used for unit and integration testing)
- Jest (considered for potential future use, but not currently implemented)
# Both Vite Test and Jest are valuable; the choice depends on specific project needs and team familiarity.
- ESLint
- TypeScript
- Lighthouse CI

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. Review and update dependencies
2. Audit security vulnerabilities
3. Update documentation
4. Review and optimize workflows

### Quarterly Reviews
1. Pipeline performance
2. Resource utilization
3. Cost optimization
4. Security assessment
