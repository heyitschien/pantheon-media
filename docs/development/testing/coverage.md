   - Error states
   - Performance monitoring

2. Modal Interactions
   - User feedback
   - Animation states
   - Accessibility

3. Navigation Flows
   - Route transitions
   - State persistence
   - Error boundaries

## Running Coverage Reports

### Local Development
```bash
# Run coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Open coverage report
open coverage/lcov-report/index.html

# Watch mode with coverage
npm run test:coverage:watch
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
Coverage reports are automatically generated and uploaded to Codecov on each pull request.

### Reading Coverage Reports

#### HTML Report Structure
```
coverage/
├── lcov-report/
│   ├── index.html          # Main report
│   ├── components/         # Component coverage
│   ├── hooks/             # Hook coverage
│   └── utils/             # Utility coverage
└── lcov.info              # Raw coverage data
```

#### Key Metrics Explained
1. **Statement Coverage**
   - Percentage of statements executed
   - Should be above 90%

2. **Branch Coverage**
   - Percentage of if/else paths taken
   - Target: 85%+

3. **Function Coverage**
   - Percentage of functions called
   - Target: 90%+

4. **Line Coverage**
   - Percentage of code lines executed
   - Target: 90%+

## Improving Coverage

### Strategies
1. **Identify Gaps**
   - Use coverage reports
   - Focus on uncovered lines
   - Prioritize critical paths

2. **Write Missing Tests**
   - Follow TDD workflow
   - Cover edge cases
   - Test error states

3. **Refactor for Testability**
   - Extract complex logic
   - Reduce dependencies
   - Improve modularity

### Common Coverage Gaps

1. **Error Handling**
```typescript
// Add tests for error cases
it('should handle API errors', async () => {
  // Mock API failure
  // Verify error handling
});
```

2. **Edge Cases**
```typescript
// Test boundary conditions
it('should handle empty states', () => {
  // Test with empty data
  // Verify UI feedback
});
```

3. **Async Operations**
```typescript
// Test loading states
it('should show loading state', async () => {
  // Trigger async operation
  // Verify loading indicator
  // Verify completion
});
```

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. Run coverage reports weekly
2. Update documentation
3. Address coverage regressions
4. Review test quality

### Quality Checks
- No commented-out tests
- Clear test descriptions
- Proper setup/teardown
- Meaningful assertions
