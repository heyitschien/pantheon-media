## Common Errors & Solutions Log

### Navigation Testing Issues

#### 1. React Router Navigation Not Working in Tests
**Error**: Navigation assertions failing, actual path remains "/"
**Root Cause**: Improper setup of React Router in test environment
**Solution**:
- Added `MemoryRouter` with initial entries
- Created `LocationDisplay` component to track navigation
- Wrapped components with proper router context

```typescript
const LocationDisplay = () => {
  const location = useLocation();
  return <div data-testid="location-display">{location.pathname}</div>;
};

const TestWrapper = ({ children }) => (
  <MemoryRouter initialEntries={['/']}>
    {children}
    <LocationDisplay />
  </MemoryRouter>
);
```

#### 2. Context Provider Mocking Issues
**Error**: `usePlayer` hook not working in tests
**Root Cause**: Incomplete mock of PlayerContext
**Solution**:
- Created proper mock with all required functions
- Added navigation functionality to mock
```typescript
vi.mock('@/contexts/PlayerContext', () => ({
  PlayerProvider: ({ children }) => (
    <div data-testid="player-provider">{children}</div>
  ),
  usePlayer: () => {
    const navigate = useNavigate();
    return {
      playMovie: (movie) => {
        mockPlayMovie(movie);
        navigate('/player-test');
      },
      // ... other required properties
    };
  },
}));
```

### Video Preview Testing Issues

#### 1. Video Playback in JSDOM
**Error**: Video methods not available in JSDOM
**Root Cause**: JSDOM doesn't support video playback
**Solution**:
- Mocked video element methods
- Added proper event simulation
```typescript
const mockVideoElement = {
  play: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
  pause: vi.fn(),
  currentTime: 0,
};
Object.defineProperty(HTMLMediaElement.prototype, 'play', mockVideoElement.play);
```

#### 2. Async Video Loading
**Error**: Tests failing due to race conditions with video loading
**Root Cause**: Video loading is asynchronous
**Solution**:
- Added proper async/await handling
- Used `waitFor` for async assertions
```typescript
await waitFor(() => {
  expect(screen.getByTestId('preview-video')).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.getByTestId('preview-video')).toHaveClass('opacity-100');
});
```

### Button Interaction Testing Issues

#### 1. Tooltip Feedback Timing
**Error**: Feedback tooltips not visible in tests
**Root Cause**: setTimeout not properly handled in tests
**Solution**:
- Used `vi.useFakeTimers()`
- Advanced timers manually in tests
```typescript
vi.useFakeTimers();
fireEvent.click(addButton);
await act(async () => {
  await vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(1500);
});
```

### Best Practices Learned

1. **Test Setup Organization**
   - Keep test setup DRY using beforeEach
   - Clear mocks between tests
   - Use consistent naming conventions

2. **Async Testing**
   - Always use waitFor for async operations
   - Handle promises properly with act()
   - Mock timers when dealing with animations/timeouts

3. **Context & Router Testing**
   - Mock contexts at the highest needed level
   - Provide proper router context for navigation
   - Test both success and error paths

4. **Component State Testing**
   - Test initial render
   - Test user interactions
   - Test cleanup and unmount

5. **Error Handling**
   - Test error states explicitly
   - Verify error messages
   - Test recovery paths

Remember to:
- Document new errors as they occur
- Update solutions when better approaches are found
- Share learnings with the team
