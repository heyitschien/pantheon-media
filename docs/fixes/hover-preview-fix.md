# Hover Preview Inconsistency Fix

## Issue Description
The hover preview module was experiencing inconsistent behavior where:
1. The preview would work correctly the first few times after page refresh
2. After several hover interactions, the preview would stop playing videos
3. Only clearing cache, refreshing the page, or navigating away and back would temporarily fix the issue

## Root Causes Identified

Through detailed diagnostic logging, we identified several issues contributing to the inconsistent hover preview behavior:

1. **State Management Issues**:
   - The `loadAttemptedRef` flag wasn't being properly reset between hover events
   - Once set to `true`, it would prevent any subsequent preview loads for the same component

2. **Resource Cleanup Problems**:
   - HLS.js instances weren't being completely destroyed between hover events
   - Video element resources weren't being properly released
   - Browser connection limits were being hit due to multiple active HLS instances

3. **Race Conditions**:
   - Multiple overlapping hover events could create race conditions
   - The hover state would change while async operations were still in progress

4. **Cache Management**:
   - The cache duration was too long (originally 1 hour)
   - Cached URLs weren't being validated before use

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Improved State Reset
- Added explicit reset of `loadAttemptedRef` when component visibility changes
- Ensured the flag is reset in cleanup functions

```typescript
// CRITICAL FIX: Always reset loadAttemptedRef when visibility changes
loadAttemptedRef.current = false;
```

### 2. Enhanced Resource Cleanup
- Implemented thorough cleanup of HLS resources:
  - Added `stopLoad()` and `detachMedia()` before `destroy()`
  - Added explicit video element cleanup (pause, remove src, load)
- Added global tracking of active HLS instances with a maximum limit

```typescript
// Clean up HLS resources completely
const cleanupHls = () => {
  if (hlsRef.current) {
    try {
      hlsRef.current.stopLoad();
      hlsRef.current.detachMedia();
      hlsRef.current.destroy();
      activeHlsInstances = Math.max(0, activeHlsInstances - 1);
    } catch (err) {
      console.error('Error cleaning up HLS:', err);
    } finally {
      hlsRef.current = null;
    }
  }
  
  // Also clean up the video element
  if (videoRef.current) {
    try {
      videoRef.current.pause();
      videoRef.current.removeAttribute('src');
      videoRef.current.load(); // This triggers browser resource release
    } catch (err) {
      console.error('Error cleaning up video element:', err);
    }
  }
};
```

### 3. Improved Hover State Management
- Added debounced hover state changes in `PantheonMediaContainer`
- Added proper timeout clearing on component unmount
- Fixed the hover delay to prevent premature closing

```typescript
// Add debounce to hover state to prevent rapid flickering
const handleHover = () => {
  // Clear any existing timeout
  if (hoverTimeoutRef.current !== null) {
    window.clearTimeout(hoverTimeoutRef.current);
    hoverTimeoutRef.current = null;
  }
  
  // Set hover state immediately without checking current state
  setIsHovered(true);
};

const handleClose = () => {
  // Increase delay slightly to prevent premature closing
  if (hoverTimeoutRef.current !== null) {
    window.clearTimeout(hoverTimeoutRef.current);
  }
  
  hoverTimeoutRef.current = window.setTimeout(() => {
    setIsHovered(false);
    hoverTimeoutRef.current = null;
  }, 100); // Slightly longer delay to prevent accidental closing
};
```

### 4. Enhanced Cache Management
- Reduced cache duration from 1 hour to 5 minutes
- Added URL validation before using cached data
- Added forced refresh option to bypass cache when needed

```typescript
// Validate cached URLs
try {
  const response = await fetch(cached.videoUrl, { method: 'HEAD' });
  if (response.ok) {
    return {
      videoUrl: cached.videoUrl,
      posterUrl: cached.posterUrl,
    };
  } else {
    console.log('Cached video URL is invalid, fetching fresh data');
    cache.delete(cacheKey);
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('Error validating cached URL:', error);
  cache.delete(cacheKey);
}
```

### 5. Added Comprehensive Logging
- Added detailed logging for all component lifecycle events
- Added request tracking and timing for API calls
- Added HLS event tracking for better debugging

## Results
- The hover preview now works consistently, even after multiple hover interactions
- Resource usage is better managed, preventing browser connection limits
- Cache management ensures fresh data is used when needed
- The user experience is improved with reliable previews

## Other Improvements

1. **Duplicate File Removal**:
   - Removed duplicate component files (`PantheonCard 2.tsx`, `PantheonMediaContainer 2.tsx`)
   - Eliminated confusion about which component versions were being used

2. **Timeout Protection**:
   - Added timeout handling for preview loading to prevent UI from getting stuck

3. **Better Error Reporting**:
   - Added more detailed error states in the UI
   - Improved console error reporting for easier debugging

## Conclusion
The root cause of the hover preview inconsistency was a combination of state management issues, inadequate resource cleanup, race conditions, and poor cache validation. By addressing all these issues together, we've created a robust solution that provides consistent behavior across repeated use.
