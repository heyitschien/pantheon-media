## 7. Structural Weaknesses

### Component Architecture Concerns
1. **Composition Issues**
   - Lack of compound components pattern in complex UI elements
   - Missing proper component composition in controls
   - Heavy prop drilling in movie-controls.tsx

2. **State Management Gaps**
   - Limited context implementation
   - Missing centralized state management
   - No clear data fetching strategy

3. **Testing Architecture Weaknesses**
   - Incomplete video player testing
   - Missing integration tests
   - No E2E testing implementation

4. **Performance Concerns**
   - No visible lazy loading implementation
   - Missing virtualization for movie rows
   - No clear video quality switching strategy

```

### Integration Points

#### 1. Code Generation & Refactoring
- Cline: Generate boilerplate & architectural changes
- Cursor AI: Handle in-file completions & implementation
- Combined: Structural improvements & quick fixes

#### 2. Testing Strategy
```typescript
// Proposed testing hierarchy
/src
  /__tests__
    /unit
    /integration
    /e2e
    /performance
```

#### 3. Component Architecture Improvements
```typescript
// Proposed VideoPlayer compound component structure
const VideoPlayer = {
  Root: ({ children, ...props }) => {},
  Controls: ({ ...props }) => {},
  Timeline: ({ ...props }) => {},
  VolumeControl: ({ ...props }) => {},
  QualitySelector: ({ ...props }) => {},
}
```

#### 4. State Management Enhancement
```typescript
// Proposed context structure
const AppStateContext = {
  player: PlayerContext,
  user: UserContext,
  preferences: PreferencesContext,
  movies: MoviesContext,
}
```
