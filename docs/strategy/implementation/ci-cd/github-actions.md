# GitHub Actions Guide

## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is an automation platform that helps you automate your software development workflows. Think of it as your personal robot assistant that can automatically perform tasks whenever something happens in your GitHub repository.

## Key Concepts (Explained Simply)

### 1. Workflows
- **What**: A recipe for automation
- **When**: Triggered by events in your repository
- **Where**: Stored in `.github/workflows` directory
- **How**: Written in YAML format

### 2. Events
Common triggers that start your workflow:
- Push to a branch
- Creating a pull request
- Creating a release
- Scheduled times
- Manual triggers

Example:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
```

### 3. Jobs
- Groups of steps that run together
- Run in parallel by default
- Can depend on other jobs
- Each job runs in a fresh virtual environment

Example:
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

### 4. Steps
- Individual tasks within a job
- Can run commands
- Can use actions
- Share data between them

Example:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout code
    uses: actions/checkout@v2
  
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: npm install
```

## Real World Examples

### 1. Basic Testing Workflow
```yaml
name: Test

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel
```yaml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: vercel/actions/cli@v2
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Code Quality Checks
- Running tests
- Linting code
- Checking types
- Analyzing code coverage

### 2. Deployment
- Deploying to staging
- Deploying to production
- Creating preview environments

### 3. Automation
- Creating releases
- Generating documentation
- Updating dependencies
- Notifying team members

## Best Practices

### 1. Security
- Use secrets for sensitive data
- Limit permissions
- Review third-party actions

### 2. Performance
- Cache dependencies
- Use specific versions of actions
- Optimize workflow triggers

### 3. Maintenance
- Use clear names
- Add comments
- Keep workflows focused

## Debugging Tips

### 1. Common Issues
- Missing secrets
- Incorrect syntax
- Permission issues
- Timing problems

### 2. How to Debug
- Check workflow logs
- Use debug logging
- Test locally when possible
- Use status badges

## Advanced Features

### 1. Matrix Builds
Test across multiple versions:
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    node-version: [14, 16, 18]
```

### 2. Conditional Steps
Run steps based on conditions:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Deploy
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    run: npm run deploy
```

### 3. Environment Variables
```yaml
env:
  NODE_ENV: production
```

## Getting Started Steps

1. Create `.github/workflows` directory
2. Create your first workflow file (e.g., `ci.yml`)
3. Add basic workflow structure
4. Commit and push
5. Check Actions tab in GitHub
