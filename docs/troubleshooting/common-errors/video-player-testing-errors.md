# Video Player Testing Errors and Solutions

## Overview
This document outlines the errors encountered during the testing of the VideoPlayer component and their respective solutions. These issues were primarily related to JSDOM's limitations with HTMLMediaElement and state management in React testing.

## Error Categories

### 1. HTMLMediaElement Method Implementation
**Error**: `Not implemented: HTMLMediaElement.prototype.load/play`
```typescript
Error: Not implemented: HTMLMediaElement.prototype.play
    at module.exports (/node_modules/jsdom/lib/jsdom/browser/not-implemented.js:9:17)
```

**Root Cause**:
- JSDOM doesn't implement media-related methods by default
- Methods like `play()`, `load()`, and properties like `muted` aren't available

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Create a proper mock of HTMLVideoElement
class MockVideoElement extends HTMLVideoElement {
  private _muted = true;

  load = mockLoad;
  play = mockPlay;
  pause = mockPause;
  currentTime = 0;

  get muted() {
    return this._muted;
  }

  set muted(value) {
    this._muted = value;
    // Trigger a custom event to ensure state updates
    fireEvent(this, new Event('volumechange'));
  }
}

// Install mock before tests
window.HTMLVideoElement = MockVideoElement as any;
```

### 2. State Update Timing Issues
**Error**: `Unable to find an element by: [data-testid="video-element"]`

**Root Cause**:
- Component state updates weren't properly awaited in tests
- React's batching of state updates caused timing issues
- Test assertions running before component updates completed

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Wait for state updates
await Promise.resolve();

// For transitions, wait for animation
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));

// Wrap state updates in act()
await act(async () => {
  fireEvent.loadedData(video);
  await Promise.resolve();
});
```

### 3. Error State Rendering
**Error**: `Unable to find an element by: [data-testid="error-state"]`

**Root Cause**:
- Error state wasn't being rendered immediately after error
- Asynchronous nature of error handling wasn't properly handled in tests

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Use findByTestId instead of getByTestId for async elements
const errorState = await screen.findByTestId('error-state');
expect(errorState).toBeInTheDocument();
```

### 4. Test Environment Detection
**Error**: Video loading in test environment causing issues

**Root Cause**:
- `load()` method being called unnecessarily in test environment
- Different behavior needed for test vs production environments

**Solution**:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (videoRef.current) {
    // Only call load in non-test environment
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'test') {
      videoRef.current.load();
    }
    videoRef.current.muted = isMuted;
  }
}, [video, isMuted]);
```

## Video Preview Mute Toggle Issues

### Problem Description
The video preview player exhibited multiple issues when toggling mute state:
1. Video would reset to beginning on mute toggle
2. Black screen would flicker during mute transition
3. Multiple opacity transitions competing with each other

### Initial Attempts That Failed
1. **State Management Approach**
```typescript
// ❌ Problematic implementation
const handleVolumeToggle = () => {
  if (videoRef.current) {
    videoRef.current.muted = !videoRef.current.muted;
    setIsMuted(videoRef.current.muted);
    // Would trigger unnecessary re-renders and state updates
  }
};
```

2. **Using requestAnimationFrame**
```typescript
// ❌ Still caused issues
const handleVolumeToggle = () => {
  requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    videoRef.current.muted = !videoRef.current.muted;
    setIsMuted(videoRef.current.muted);
  });
};
```

3. **Multiple Wrapper Divs with Transitions**
```typescript
// ❌ Caused cascading transitions
<div className="transition-opacity ...">
  <div className="transition-opacity ...">
    <video className="transition-opacity ..." />
  </div>
</div>
```

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Transition Cascade**:
   - Multiple nested elements with opacity transitions
   - Each transition triggering independently
   - Causing visual artifacts during state changes

2. **State Dependencies**:
   - `handleMouseEnter` depending on `isMuted` state
   - Causing unnecessary video resets on mute toggle
   - Video playback being affected by mute state changes

3. **Event Bubbling**:
   - Click events propagating up the DOM tree
   - Causing parent handlers to trigger
   - Leading to unexpected state updates

### Working Solution
1. **Simplified DOM Structure**:
```typescript
// ✅ Single transition point
{previewVideo && (
  <div className="absolute inset-0">
    <div className="relative w-full h-full">
      <video
        className={cn(
          "absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-cover",
          "transition-opacity duration-500",
          showVideo ? "opacity-100" : "opacity-0"
        )}
        // ... other props
      />
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

2. **Improved Event Handling**:
```typescript
// ✅ Proper event handling
const handleVolumeToggle = useCallback((event: React.MouseEvent) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  event.stopPropagation();
  
  if (videoRef.current) {
    const newMutedState = !videoRef.current.muted;
    videoRef.current.muted = newMutedState;
    setIsMuted(newMutedState);
  }
}, []);
```

3. **Optimized State Management**:
```typescript
// ✅ Controlled video initialization
onLoadedData={() => {
  if (videoRef.current) {
    videoRef.current.muted = isMuted;
  }
}}
```

### Key Learnings
1. **Transition Management**:
   - Keep transitions at a single level when possible
   - Avoid nested opacity transitions
   - Use proper CSS classes for transitions

2. **Event Handling**:
   - Always prevent event bubbling for media controls
   - Handle state updates atomically
   - Avoid unnecessary dependencies in callbacks

3. **Video State**:
   - Initialize video state on load
   - Maintain separate concerns for playback and audio
   - Use proper event handlers for state synchronization

### Best Practices Moving Forward
1. Keep video transitions at the video element level
2. Prevent event propagation for media controls
3. Separate playback logic from audio control
4. Use proper event handlers for state management
5. Minimize state dependencies in effect callbacks
6. Document complex interactions and their solutions

This solution provides a robust foundation for handling video preview interactions while maintaining smooth transitions and proper state management.

## Best Practices Learned

1. **Mock Implementation**
   - Create comprehensive mocks for media elements
   - Include getters/setters for properties
   - Trigger appropriate events when properties change

2. **State Management**
   - Always wrap state updates in `act()`
   - Use `Promise.resolve()` to wait for state updates
   - Consider transition timings in tests

3. **Async Testing**
   - Use `findBy*` queries for elements that appear asynchronously
   - Properly handle promises in event handlers
   - Account for animation/transition durations

4. **Environment Awareness**
   - Check `process.env.NODE_ENV` for environment-specific code
   - Provide test-specific implementations when needed
   - Mock browser APIs not available in JSDOM

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't assume synchronous updates**
   - Always wait for state updates
   - Consider React's batching behavior
   - Account for transition timings

2. **Don't ignore environment differences**
   - Browser vs JSDOM behavior differences
   - Production vs test environment needs
   - Media element limitations

3. **Don't skip error handling**
   - Test both success and error paths
   - Verify error states are properly rendered
   - Handle asynchronous errors appropriately
