# Pantheon Media Platform - Project Overview

## Project Context
A modern streaming platform built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, focusing on cinematic storytelling and regenerative lifestyle content. The platform features Netflix-style interactions with a unique visual identity.

## Current Focus
Working on implementing and debugging the hover pop-up card preview feature, specifically:
1. âœ… Hero section video player (Working)

   - Base card display
   - Hover preview functionality
   - Video integration
   - Interactive controls

2. Video Integration
   - Bunny.net streaming service
   - HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) implementation
   - Video quality management
   - Caching system

3. UI Components
   - Custom video controls
   - Modal system
   - Loading states
   - Error handling

## Current Challenges

### 1. Video Preview System
- Hover state management
- Video loading optimization
- Cache management
- Error handling

### 2. UI/UX Considerations
- Transition smoothness

â””â”€â”€ contexts/
    â””â”€â”€ PlayerContext.tsx       // Video player state management
```

## Current Status
1. Base Implementation
   - âœ… Basic card structure
   - âœ… Video player integration
   - âœ… Modal system
   - ðŸš§ Hover preview

2. Features
   - âœ… Video streaming
   - âœ… Quality selection
   - ðŸš§ Preview caching
   - ðŸš§ Error handling

3. Testing
   - âœ… Component tests
   - ðŸš§ Integration tests
   - ðŸš§ Performance testing

## Next Steps
1. Optimize hover preview loading
2. Enhance error handling
3. Improve performance
4. Complete testing suite

# Related Files of the build.

Let me analyze the files related to the Bunny.net streaming implementation that we've been working with.

Let me search for related files:

Search files...


Let me analyze the files that are related to the Bunny.net streaming implementation and have been involved in our troubleshooting efforts:

1. Core Service File:
- `src/services/bunny-stream.ts`: This is the main service file that handles all Bunny.net video streaming functionality. It contains:
  - Video asset configuration
  - Cache management
  - API integration
  - Video URL generation
  - Preview video fetching
  - Hero video fetching

2. Components Using the Service:
- `src/components/ui/movie-card.tsx`: Uses `getPreviewVideo` for hover previews
- `src/components/ui/movie-info-modal.tsx`: Uses `getPreviewVideo` for modal previews
- `src/components/hero.tsx`: Uses `getHeroVideo` for the hero section video

3. Test Files:
- `src/components/ui/__tests__/movie-info-modal.test.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/__tests__/movie-card.test.tsx`

The main issues we've been working on are in these areas:

1. Video Preview System:
```typescript
// In bunny-stream.ts
export async function getPreviewVideo(
  videoId: string,
  options: GetPreviewVideoOptions = {}
): Promise<{ videoUrl: string; posterUrl: string }> {
  // ... implementation with caching and error handling
}
```

2. HLS Implementation:
```typescript
// In movie-info-modal.tsx and movie-card.tsx
const initHls = async (videoElement: HTMLVideoElement, videoUrl: string) => {
  if (Hls.isSupported()) {
    const hls = new Hls({
      enableWorker: true,
      lowLatencyMode: true,
    });
    // ... HLS initialization
  }
}
```

3. Cache Management:
```typescript
// In bunny-stream.ts
const cache = new Map<string, { videoUrl: string; posterUrl: string; timestamp: number }>();
const CACHE_DURATION = 1000 * 60 * 60; // 1 hour
```

The main challenges we've been addressing:
1. Video loading and caching optimization
2. HLS stream initialization and error handling
3. Transition states between video states
4. Error recovery and fallback mechanisms

Would you like me to focus on any specific aspect of these implementations or explore a particular area in more detail?

Confidence Score: 98% - The analysis is based on direct file contents and clear implementation patterns. The only slight uncertainty is around potential additional files that might be indirectly related to the Bunny.net implementation that weren't captured in the initial search.
